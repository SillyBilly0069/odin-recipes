Odin Project : Recipes

This is my very project on The Odin Project (TOP) "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes" and I am about to create a recipe website I would say, according to what I am reading, code I'll use is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and obviously, it's for learning/practicing purposes.
